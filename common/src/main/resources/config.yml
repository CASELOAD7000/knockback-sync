# Do not modify!
config_version: 7

# Plugin enabled state
# Toggleable using /knockbacksync toggle
# Required permission: knockbacksync.toggle
enabled: true

# Notify staff about update availability

# Automatically updates the plugin
# Only servers with restart compatibility can use this feature
auto_update: false

# Grabs the ping of combat-tagged players every x ticks
# Disabling this may lead to inaccuracies in calculations
runnable:
  enabled: true       # Runnable enabled state
  interval: 5         # The interval in ticks between sending out pings to players
  combat_timer: 30    # The timer in ticks before being considered out of combat

# The minimum change in ping required for it to be considered a lag spike.
# If the difference between the latest and previous ping is greater than or equal to
# the threshold, the previous ping value is used to avoid calculation inaccuracies.
spike_threshold: 20

# OPTIONS: KEEPALIVE, PING, TRANSACTION - PING and TRANSACTION are aliases for each other and are effectively the same
# The packet type used to measure ping by the runnable.
# KEEPALIVE is the most accurate however sending too many of them too often (such as using a runnable with a low interval)
# - May disconnect players, especially laggy ones if sent too often
# - The default interval of 20 ticks or 1 second
#    means it is in theory possible for a player to have a ping spike in-between two sword attacks
#    and have it immediately spike back down, slightly throwing off knockback synchronization
#    in practice this is very rare and the extra ping accuracy and precision is more valued
# PING/TRANSACTION can be sent more often (and therefore better detect ping spikes) but are less precise
# ping measured in ms with PING/TRANSACTION is typically within ± 5ms of actual but can be up to 50ms off
ping_strategy: "KEEPALIVE"

# Whether to try to detect when player is offground and apply less kb
enable_offground_synchronization: true

# This is the rate the server will use for (amongst other things) sending packets about entities to players
# In other words it defines how often clients get updated velocity for other entities in the world
# Note that certain events mark velocity as dirty and causes it to be immediately updated for 1 tick regardless of the tick interval
# These include but are not limited to jumping, taking knockback, swimming, and a target entity being affected by a special mob attack
# Such as the Ender Dragon's knockback attacks
# If an entity below doesn't exist in the version of the game your server is running in, changing the config for it will do nothing
# Currently only modifying the player's tick interval is supported on Bukkit/Spigot/Paper + Folia
# Modifying the tick interval of any entity is supported on Fabric.
entity_tick_intervals:
  player: 2 # This is 2 by default in vanilla and paper, change to 1 to test out the new feature
